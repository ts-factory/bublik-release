# Highlights

### Authentication Module

At the moment, the Bublik authentication module exists separately from the rest of the Bublik functionality. If you want to test its work, you can contact the developer of the Bublik.

:::info
The authentication module in the Bublik has nothing to do with authentication on the server. Thus, you cannot access the system using your server credentials. To access the system, you need to be registered directly in the Bublik authentication module.

#### User

Registration
Users who are not project administrators are registered in the system by the administrator. After user registration, a verification link will be sent to the email address specified during registration. The user will be able to log in only after confirming the email address by clicking on the link from the incoming email.
